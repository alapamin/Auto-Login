# Auto-Login

This was a simple project I wanted to do becasue I found myself constantly having to turn on my device, open my web browser, open this website, and then log into it. I just wanted to see if there was an easier process for getting it done and turns out there was! 

This utilizes a python module named selenium to grab certain HTML elements on a website (the username and password fields), and inputs a given username and password to both fields, and from there will grab the 'login' button and simulate a left click on it. 

This essentially logs the user into the website with 1 button!
